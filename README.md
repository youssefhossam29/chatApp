     1. Sign up or log in at [Pusher's website](https://pusher.com).
     2. Create a new app in your Pusher dashboard, selecting `Laravel` as the backend technology.
     3. Retrieve your Pusher credentials (App ID, Key, Secret, and Cluster) from the app's dashboard.

   - **Add Pusher Credentials to `.env`:**
     1. Open the `.env` file in your project.
     2. Paste your Pusher credentials:
        ```env
